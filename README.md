- `*(ptr + i)`: The value of whatever `ptr` is pointed at plus `i`
- `&thing`: The address of `thing`
- `type *ptr = &thing`: A pointer of `type` named `ptr` set to the address of `thing`
- `ptr++`: increment to where `ptr` points

## Ex16: Structs and pointers to them

### Aditional pointers Lexicon:

- `ptr->elem`: Use pointer to struct/union to get `elem`

Use an `->` when you have a pointer to a struct
